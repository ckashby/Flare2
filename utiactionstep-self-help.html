    <h2>Self Help Strategies</h2>
      <p>While you're waiting for your urine culture results and/or for antibiotics to kick in, there are several things that you can do to help reduce your bladder symptoms&gt; </p>
      <p><strong>Hydration </strong></p>
      <p>It's VERY important to drink your normal 6 to 8 glasses of water to dilute your urine and flush your bladder of bacteria. </p>
      <p><strong>Avoid Cranberry Products</strong></p>
      <p>For the patient with the uber sensitive bladder and/or IC, cranberry is harsh and often quite painful. It's an old wives tale that cranberry can help prevent infections. Research has shown little effectiveness. On the otherhand, D-Mannose has modest evidence showing that it might help reduce e-coli based infections. </p>
      <p><strong>AZO Bladder Pain Relief Tablets</strong></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.icnsales.com/azo-urinary-pain-relief-tablets.html">AZO Bladder Pain Relief Tablets </a>may help reduce the symptoms and discomfort of an infection. It is not, however, an antibiotic. It is ONLY used to reduce the discomfort associated with a UTI. </p>
      <p><strong>Heat therapy </strong></p>
      <p>Use a heating pad and/or, take a warm shower to help relax your pelvic floor muscles. Muscles naturally tighten as a response to pain which can create more discomfort. Heat may help relax those muscles.</p>
      <p><strong>Pain Medication </strong></p>
      <p>Infections can be very painful thus the use of a short-term pain medication is often suggested and would be prescribed by your physician. <a href="http://www.icnsales.com/azo-urinary-pain-relief-tablets.html">AZO Bladder Pain Relief Tablets</a> may also help reduce pain and discomfort. </p>

      <p class="alert-danger">CAUTION - Please contact your physician if you have any alarming symptoms and/or if they don't improve within a reasonable amount of time. Bacterial infections can be notoriously difficult to treat due to the rise in antibiotic resistent infections. </p>
