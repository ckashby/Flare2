    </header>

      <p>With todays often high chemical load in  bath products and fabrics it's not unusual for people to develop rashs on their arms, legs, back, bottom and, for some men, the tip of their penis and urethral opening. </p>
      <p>Common Irritants: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perfumed, strong soaps created for &quot;men&quot; such as Irish Spring or Dial on your body and crotch area.  </li>
        <li>Bath wipes such as Cottonelle. These can cause rectal and perineal burning in men who chemical sensitivy just as they often cause vulvar pain in women. </li>
        <li>Bath salts or bubble baths. </li>
        <li>Scented laundry products (detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets)</li>
        <li>Stimulatory lubricants (i.e. that cause heat, etc) or those that contain propylene glycol, a preservative well known for irritating tender skin.</li>
        <li>Latex condoms - Both you and your partner could have a mild latex allergy. Try polyurethane ones instead</li>
        <li>New clothing, especially jeans, boxers and briefs, that have not been washed.</li>
        <li>Going commando in jeans (can you say chafing?)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>ACTION STEPS</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use mild, scent free soaps for sensitive skin such as Dove or Basis.</li>
        <li>Use a perineal wash bottle to rinse after bowel movements, then pat dry with toilet tissue.</li>
        <li>Take a soak in a warm tub (daily, if necessary) using 1/2 cup of baking soda in your bathwater or Great Mother's Sitz Baths</li>
        <li>Use only mild, unscented laundry detergents, such as Arm &amp; Hammer For Sensitive Skin (Rinse twice to remove all soap residue.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="alert-danger">CAUTION - Please contact your physician if you have any alarming symptoms and/or if they don't improve within a reasonable amount of time. Bacterial infections can be notoriously difficult to treat due to the rise in antibiotic resistent infections.</p>
