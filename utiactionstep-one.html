      <p>If you have some or all of the symptoms associated with a UTI, then you must rule it out first. Luckily, there are OTC urine test kits that can help! </p>
      <h2>Step One - Testing </h2>
      <p><strong><img src="http://www.icnsales.com/images/products/preview/utitest.jpg" alt="AZO UTI Home Test Kits" align="right">AZO Urinary Test Strips </strong></p>
      <p>Test your urine with the same test strips (we use <a href="http://www.icnsales.com/uti-home-test-kit.html">AZO UTI Home Test Kits)</a> that many physicians use. Simply dip a strip into your urine stream (as you are peeing, not from the toilet) for a few seconds to soak the two small pads on the strip. (<a href="http://www.azoproducts.com/products/azo-test-strips">Click here for Instructions</a>). AZO pads test for leukocytes (white blood cells) and nitrites. Leukocytes occur when the body is fighting infection and, for many patients, during traditional IC flares. Nitrites are a  produced by bacterial cells. Compare your strips with the colors providing on the envelope.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No color change -  If neither pad changes color, then you don't have infection and you are suffering from bladder wall irritation instead.</li>
        <li>Double Positive - If you have signs of both leukocytes and nitrites in your urine, you likely do have an infection and should contact your doctor to request a urine culture. </li>
        <li>Positive Leukocyte, Negative Nitrite - This can be the result of bladder wall irritation and, perhaps, infection. </li>
        <li>Negative Leukoctye, Positive Nitrite - This is strongly suggestive of infection. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Request A Urine Culture</strong></p>
      <p> If the AZO test is double positive and/or you have blood in your urine, fever and/or cloudy urine, call your doctor and ask for a urine culture. Your goal is to identify the type of infection and which antibiotic will be most effective at killing it. If you fail to do this, both you and your doctor are just guessing about the type of infection and/or the best antibiotic to use.</p>

      <p class="alert-danger">CAUTION - Please contact your physician if you have any alarming symptoms and/or if they don't improve within a reasonable amount of time. Bacterial infections can be notoriously difficult to treat due to the rise in antibiotic resistent infections.</p>
