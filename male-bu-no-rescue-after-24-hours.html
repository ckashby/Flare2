<p>As you continue the strategies used previously, the following medical interventions may be considered.<br>
  </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rescue Instillations</strong> - One of the most popular therapies in use today are rescue instillations (aka Hep-Lido-A - Imprimis Pharmaceuticals) because they may provide immediate and sustained pain relief for some patients.  IC researcher Dr. Lowell Parsons released the results of a study which found that 94% of patients receiving a 2% lidocaine instillation reported immediate symptom relief after one instillation and 80% of those patients had sustained relief after a two week period. He wrote<em> &quot;Intravesical treatment with combined heparin and alkalinized lidocaine immediately reduced the pain and urgency of IC in most patients treated for newly diagnosed IC.&quot;</em><br>
    </li>
  <li>Please note that many physicians customize their rescue instillation formulas to include various ingredients. A rescue instillation should not be confused with a DMSO instillation, which can painful. <br>
