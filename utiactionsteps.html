      <p>Urinary tract infections generally respond well to antibiotic treatment, often within just a few day, provided that the proper medication is used.  If your symptoms don't improve with antibiotic treatment, contact your doctor immediately. Generally, you should feel some relief after just a few days. Don't stop your antibiotics too early. Follow your doctors instructions. Take a probiotic, such as acidiphilous, to help restore the healthy, good bacteria in your gut.</p>
      
      <p class="alert-danger">CAUTION - Please contact your physician if you have any alarming symptoms and/or if they don't improve within a reasonable amount of time. Bacterial infections can be notoriously difficult to treat due to the rise in antibiotic resistent infections. </p>
