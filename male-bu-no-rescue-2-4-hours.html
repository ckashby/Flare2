<p>If your pain has lasted longer than two hours, then it's clear that your bladder has become very irritated or inflamed and you may be in this for several hours or until your bladder calms down.

  <li><strong>Other Medications</strong> - Some patients may be advised to use a rescue instillation (aka Hep-Lido-A) at home to help numb the bladder wall and ease discomfort. Others may find relief using prescribed medical marijuana if it is legally available in your state. </li>
