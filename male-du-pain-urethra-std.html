      <p>The other &quot;infection&quot; in the room is an STD. Sexually transmitted diseases are well known to attack and irritate the urethra, causing tremendous urethral discomfort. Yes, we're talking about gonorrhea, chlamydia, HPV, and herpes simplex, among others. The symptoms of an STD can be mild or acute, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>discharge (greenish yellor or white) from the penis</li>
        <li>blood in semen or urine</li>
        <li>itching or burning at the opening of the penis</li>
        <li>burning in the throat (due to oral sex)</li>
        <li>painful or swollen testicles</li>
        <li>swollen glands in the groin or throat</li>
        <li>burning with urination</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ACTION STEP - If you struggle with these symptoms, you MUST contact your physician quickly. Given the highly contagious nature of these infections, it's important that they be ruled out quickly. </p>

      <p class="alert-danger">CAUTION - Please contact your physician if you have any alarming symptoms and/or if they don't improve within a reasonable amount of time. Bacterial infections can be notoriously difficult to treat due to the rise in antibiotic resistent infections.</p>
