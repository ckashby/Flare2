    <div class="paragraph" role="male-bu-no">
      <p>The hallmark symptom of a bladder wall flare is discomfort that worsens as your bladder fills with urine. Why? Because urine is touching and irritating the sensitive areas on the bladder wall. Many bladder wall flares are short-term and the direct result of eating or drinking something irritating. Self-help strategies and basic pain care can help but the best treatment for a bladder wall flare is to avoid those foods which created the problem in the first place.</p>
      
      <h2>Action Steps </h2>
      <h3>#1 - Hydration </h3>
      <p>Drink a normal 6 to 8 glasses of water to dilute your urine and reduce acid levels, if present.</p>
      <h3>#2 - Diet Modification </h3>
      <p>Most newly diagnosed patients are given a list of foods to avoid, particularly foods high in acids &amp; caffeines (soda, coffee's, teas, green teas, citrus, tomato, etc.) If you're unclear about what foods are bladder friendly vs. bladder irritating, see the <a href="http://www.ic-network.com/patient-resources/diet/diet-introduction/">ICN IC &amp; Prostatitis Diet List</a></p>
      <h3>#3 - Alkalyze Urine</h3>
      <p> If you've been eating high acidic foods, you can try to reduce the acid by using <a href="http://www.icnsales.com/prelief-acid-reducer/">Prelief </a>or 1/4 tsp of baking soda in a regular glass of water. This can reduce the impact of the acid on your bladder wall but it should not be done more than once a day. Baking soda is high in sodium which can contribute to high blood pressure.</p>
      <h3>#4 - OTC Bladder Pain Relievers </h3>
<p>AZO Bladder Pain Relief tablets act by numbing the bladder wall and may provide some relief. This is the OTC version of the medication Pyridium and will turn urine a dark orange color. </p>
      <h3>#5 - Heat therapy </h3>
      <p>Use a heating pad, take a warm shower to help relax your pelvic floor muscles. Muscles naturally tighten as a response to pain which can create more discomfort. Heat may help relax those muscles.</p>
      <h3>#6 - Antispasmodics </h3>
      <p>If you struggle with bladder spasms (a sharp cramping that occurs at the end of urination), doctors may provide an antispasmodic medication like Ditropan. These can calm spasms in as a little as 30 minutes but, if used over a long period of time, may make it more difficult to urinate.</p>
      <h3>#7 - Pain Medication </h3>
      <p>As prescribed by your physician. Bladder wall pain can be excruciating for some patients and has been rated equivalent to cancer pain. The American Urological Association encourages physicians to not only assess pain at every clinical visit but also to treat pain compassionately and promptly using a variety of medications, including opiate medication if necessary. </p>
