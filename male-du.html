	  <p>Let's first rule out any urethral conditions. Your urethra is the narrow tube through that both urine and semen travel through as they leave your body. It's about eight inches long and is susceptible to a variety of infections, irritation, inflammation and  trauma. Do you feel pain at the tip your penis? In the shaft? Near the base? Urethral pain often has a burning sensation. </p>

  <h2>Urethral/Penis Pain</h2>
	<p>There are several potential causes of urethral pain, including a variety of infections and something as simple as chemical sensitivity. While most IC patients test negative for infection during IC flares, UTI can happen. Thus, we'll want to rule out potential infections first.</p>
