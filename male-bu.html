    <h1 class="header-subtitle">Pain Before Urination </h1>
    <p class="header-subtitle">Pain that worsens as the bladder fills and is relieved when you urinate is usually associated with  bladder infection or wall irritation.  Many interstitial cystitis patients mistakenly assume that their IC flare is an infection because the symptoms are nearly identical but there are subtle differences.</p>

    <p>Let's rule out infection first. It's fairly easy to do!</p>

    <h2 class="header-subtitle">Signs &amp; Symptoms of Infection</h2>
    <p class="header-subtitle">In addition to urinary frequency and urgency, bladder infections can be distinguished from IC flares through more subtle symptoms, including: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Burning or tingling during urination<br>
        </li>
      <li> Visible blood in the urine (pinkish urine or the passage of bright red blood clots)<br>
        </li>
      <li> Low-Grade fever<br>
        </li>
      <li> Cloudy urine <br>
        </li>
      <li> Trouble starting urine stream </li>
    </ul>
		<h2>You may also be at risk for infection if: </h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>You've recently been catheterized or had a bladder testing involving a cystoscope, you may have developed an infection from the instrumentation. </li>
		  <li>You struggle with urinary retention due to BPH or tight pelvic floor muscles (PFD), bacteria can prosper in urine residue on the bladder.</li>
		  <li>You've had a recent UTI that was treated with antibiotics. More and more bladder infections are becoming resistant to standard antibiotics. You may need additional treatment with another antibiotic. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Select &quot;yes&quot; if you have any of the subtle symptoms or risk factors above. Otherwise select the "No" button</h3>
